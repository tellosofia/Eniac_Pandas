# Case Study: Discount Analysis for Eniac

## Project Overview
This project involves analyzing internal, non-anonymized data to determine the impact of discounting products on an e-commerce platform called Eniac. The analysis will be performed using Python due to the complexity and nature of the tasks.

## Objectives
The main goal is to provide insights into whether discounting products is beneficial for the company. The analysis aims to address several key business questions:

- **Product Classification:** How should products be classified into different categories to simplify reports and analysis?
- **Price Distribution:** What is the distribution of product prices across different categories?
- **Discount Analysis:** How many products are being discounted, and how significant are these discounts as a percentage of the product prices?
- **Seasonality Impact:** How do seasonality and special dates (e.g., Christmas, Black Friday) affect sales?
- **Data Collection Improvement:** How could data collection be improved for better analysis?

## Methodology
The project will involve:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing to handle the chaotic nature of the internal data.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution and characteristics of the data.
- Statistical analysis and visualization to answer the business questions.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Data Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Data Processing:** Pandas
- **Notebook Environment:** Google Colab

## Expected Outcomes
The analysis will provide a clear understanding of the impact of discounts on sales and revenue, helping to inform strategic decisions about pricing and discount strategies.
